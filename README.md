# Container Linux on Bare Metal Workshop

Workshop covering best practices for running a Containerized Linux such as Flat Car on Bare Metal without diving into Kubernetes.

This repository is [Experimental](https://github.com/packethost/standards/blob/master/experimental-statement.md) meaning that it's based on untested ideas or techniques and not yet established or finalized or involves a radically new and innovative style! This means that support is best effort (at best!) and we strongly encourage you to NOT use this in production.

## Topics

* Clustering Nodes
* Central Services
* Upgrading Nodes in a Production Cluster with [LockSmith](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/locksmith)
* Scaling a Cluster
* Securing the Nodes

# Master hosts

## Lab Master Host

The "Lab Master" machine can be deployed as a "t1.small.x86" (Ubuntu 16.04) since it doesn't require very much horsepower. This host does need to be accessible from the internet.


## Requirements
```bash
# Install requirements
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/packet-labs/ContainerLinuxOnBareMetal/master/setup/requirements.sh |Â bash
```

## Packet API Key and Project ID
Get your User API key (not Project API key) following these directions under "User Level API Key": https://support.packet.com/kb/articles/api-integrations

Setup an environment PACKET_AUTH_TOKEN with the Packet User API key from the above set.

```bash
export PACKET_AUTH_TOKEN="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456"
export PACKET_PROJECT_ID="ABCDEFGH-ABCD-ABCD-ABCD-ABCDEFGHIJKL"
```

You might want to place this in your ~/.bashrc so it is available everytime you login.


## Usage
The following usage assumes that you are in the `~/ContainerLinuxOnBareMetal/setup/` directory.

In `labs.ini` configure the labs as desired, then run `ansible-playbook -i labs.ini  main.yml`

### Configure the Packet facility
In `labs.ini` you can set a default `packet_facility` option in the `[labs:vars]` section and then override on a per lab basis by appending `packet_facility=example` at the end of the line describing a given lab.

### Limit to a specific lab
To (re)setup the lab1 and lab4 use the `--limit` option as follows: `ansible-playbook -i labs.ini  main.yml --limit lab1,lab4`


### Customize labs

You can use the `plan` to select a different hardware type for the nodes. The `number_nodes` options allow you to configure lab cluster size.

### Destroy labs

:warning: this will run a `terraform destroy` and will delete all data in the labs.
To destroy **all** labs use the `-e terraform_state=absent` option as follows: `ansible-playbook -i labs.ini  main.yml -e terraform_state=absent`.

You can also delete a specific lab by combining it with the `--limit` option like so: `ansible-playbook -i labs.ini  main.yml --limit lab1,lab4 -e terraform_state=absent` will delete only lab1 and lab4 without doing anything with other labs.

### Excluding certain task

You can use `--skip-tags` to skip certain steps (useful for tests).
